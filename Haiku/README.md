Documentation Process
The first thing I did was to get terminal up and running and test out the commands that are in the read me. I remembered my problem in class was trying to find out where the actual aiff file was saving because it wasnt my documents folder. I had to change directory (CD) I typed that command and at first I tried to just drag in the documents folder like the instructions stated, but it gave me an error saying "No such file or directory", so I typed it in manually, just by putting " 'cd' Documents'", and that solved it. I then typed in the command to have Terminal read and create the aiff file with 'say' -v "Samantha" "Over the winty forest, winds howl in the rage with no leaves to blow" -o Haiku.aiff. And then the aiff saved to my documents folder and works fine. Some problem solving had to be done, but I got it figured out with just a little critcal thinking, I really have to start thinking like a computer and this is just the first step.
