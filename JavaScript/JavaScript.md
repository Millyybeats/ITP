Miles Winley Java Script Reading 
## Chapter 1
1. I Know: I knew that bits are usually described as zeros and ones and have different forms such as high or low electrical charges or a strong/weak signal. 
2. New: A lot of this information is new to me, however one that stuck out to me and I still dont quite understand fully is the %(modulo) operator and how it is used. 
## Chapter 2 
1. I Know: Wow this one was a rough one to get through. The only information I knew were some of the terms that this chapter reads about. Terms like "Function", "Variable", and "expression". Prior to this chapter I could give you a VERY brief summary of what these are in the coding world.
2. New: Again alot of this information is new to me, the one that sparked my interested the most was the control flow section and the different types: Straight line control flow, Conditional Execution, and Loops. 
## Chapter 3
1. I Know: I knew that function are created by using the keyword "function" and that it can have multiple parameters.
2. New: The most interesting new thing for me in this chapter was the "Call Stack". Knowing that there is a possibliity for a stack to be too big and can cause an error in an execution because of that is interesting.
