## Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
1. I began starting off by putting const F = 99; with the help of Rachel she explained that since that this is a conversion expression it needs to be let F = 99; because we will change the value of Fahrenheit depending on what we want to calculate to Celsius.
2. Next I put const C = (F - 32) (5 / 9); This wouldn't work because the computer doesn't do calculations like we do and it needs the * (for multiplication) in between. So I rewrote it to const C = (F - 32) * (5 /  9);
3. Lastly I needed to put console.log(C); so that we can see our value, in this case with F = 99 that in Celsius would be 37.222222222
